    - game (FK to Game)
    - review
    - date
    - slug

class Tags:
    - label
```

### CSS Improvements
- **CSS Variables** for consistent theming
- **Flexbox and Grid** layouts for modern design
- **Responsive breakpoints** for mobile compatibility
- **Animation keyframes** for subtle motion effects
- **Organized CSS structure** with clear comments

### Template Enhancements
- Improved semantic HTML structure
- Django template inheritance for consistent layouts

- Conditional rendering for empty states

## Running the Project

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Load sample data:
   ```bash
   python manage.py load_sample_data
   ```

5. Run development server:
   ```bash
   python run_django.py
   ```

6. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Visual Hierarchy** - Important elements stand out through size, color, and placement
