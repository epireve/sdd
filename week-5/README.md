# Week 5: Django Web Development Journey

This week's tutorial consists of two parts: enhancing the PhoneRadar project and creating a new Game Reviews platform.

## Part A: PhoneRadar Enhancement ðŸ“±

### Hero Section Update
We improved the PhoneRadar project's homepage by updating its hero section for better user engagement.

**Before the Update:**

- Enhanced visual design
- Improved user experience
- More engaging hero section

## Part B: Game Reviews Platform ðŸŽ®

In this section, we built a new Django application for game reviews using Class-Based Views, demonstrating the evolution from basic functionality to a polished web interface.

### 1. Initial Implementation
Our journey began with a basic, unstyled implementation of the game reviews page:

- Basic HTML structure
- Raw data display
- Functional but minimal design

### 2. Enhanced User Interface
We transformed the basic page with modern CSS styling:

- Responsive grid layout
- Card-based design with hover effects
- Professional typography and spacing
- Subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Cohesive color scheme

### 3. Game Management Interface
The admin interface provides comprehensive game management:

A robust system for managing game reviews:
